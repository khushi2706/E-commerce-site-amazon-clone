2. Create Header 
    - We need a couple of icons in the navigation bar, like the search icon and the basket icon. React has a UI framework called Material-UI, which helps in building our frontend. Install the @material-ui/core and the @material-ui/icons packages
    - Create a new component called Header
    Add the amazon logo to the navigation bar.
    - Add a search bar. The search bar should also have a search icon. It need not be functional at the moment.
    - Create the navigation section of the header. Add the following sections:
       - Login
       - Returns & Orders
       - Amazon Prime
       - Shopping Basket
    - Add the necessary code in the .css file of the component so that it looks similar to the one of Amazon.
